# Deployment Handoff — UC San Diego Passports Visitor Management

## App

- **Name / one-line purpose:** Passports visitor check-in and queue management for UC San Diego Passport Services (CSC and Bookstore locations).
- **Repo:** https://github.com/dominicfeliton/passports-app — private? Public
- **Image:** `ghcr.io/dominicfeliton/passports-app` — build workflow status: ✅
- **Stack:** Python/FastAPI + SQLite (aiosqlite), React/Vite SPA served from the same container

## Configuration

| Env var | Purpose | Example (non-secret) | Secret? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite database path | `sqlite+aiosqlite:////data/passports.db` | no |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Signing key for auth tokens | — | **yes — install as Secret** |
| `LOCATION_CSC_PASSWORD_HASH` | CSC dashboard bcrypt password hash | — | **yes — install as Secret** |
| `LOCATION_BOOKSTORE_PASSWORD_HASH` | Bookstore dashboard bcrypt password hash | — | **yes — install as Secret** |

- **App Secret needed:** `passports-app-secrets` with keys `JWT_SECRET`, `LOCATION_CSC_PASSWORD_HASH`, and `LOCATION_BOOKSTORE_PASSWORD_HASH`. Values delivered out-of-band.
- **TLS Secret needed:** `passports.apps.ucsd.edu` with `tls.crt` and `tls.key`, or provision that secret through the cluster TLS/cert-manager flow.
- **Ingress responsibility:** CORS headers and rate limiting are owned by ingress/WAF policy, not by the app container.
- **Persistence:** SQLite database at `/data/passports.db`, expected size 1Gi. Litestream enabled — live DB on node-local `emptyDir`, PVC as replica target.

## Dashboard credentials

No public default passwords are seeded. The app fails startup unless
`JWT_SECRET`, `LOCATION_CSC_PASSWORD_HASH`, and
`LOCATION_BOOKSTORE_PASSWORD_HASH` are supplied. The configured hashes are the
sole source of truth. On every start, the app validates and loads them for
authentication, creates missing location rows, and refreshes database copies as
derived state. A new or restored database therefore cannot override dashboard
credentials. Generate initial bcrypt hashes with:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$NEW_CSC_PASSWORD" | \
  python -m backend.manage_passwords hash --password-stdin

printf '%s\n' "$NEW_BOOKSTORE_PASSWORD" | \
  python -m backend.manage_passwords hash --password-stdin
```

Expose the generated values to the pod with the required Secret object:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: passports-app-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  JWT_SECRET: "<random 32+ byte secret>"
  LOCATION_CSC_PASSWORD_HASH: "<bcrypt hash>"
  LOCATION_BOOKSTORE_PASSWORD_HASH: "<bcrypt hash>"
```

### Production password rotation

1. From a trusted terminal, run the rotation helper inside the live application
   pod. It verifies the current password and checks the new password against the
   other configured location, but does not mutate Kubernetes or the database:

```bash
kubectl -n tai-passport exec -it deploy/passports-app -- \
  python -m backend.manage_passwords change --location csc
```

2. Copy the final bcrypt hash printed to stdout and replace only the matching
   value in the admin-managed Secret; for this example:

```yaml
stringData:
  LOCATION_CSC_PASSWORD_HASH: "<exact hash printed by the change command>"
```

3. Apply the updated Secret. A Secret update does not alter environment
   variables in the existing pod, so the old password remains active until the
   deployment is restarted:

```bash
kubectl -n tai-passport apply -f passports-app-secrets.yaml
```

4. Restart and watch the rollout. The new pod loads the authoritative Secret
   hash and refreshes the derived database copy during startup:

```bash
kubectl -n tai-passport rollout restart deploy/passports-app
kubectl -n tai-passport rollout status deploy/passports-app
```

Repeat with `--location bookstore` and
`LOCATION_BOOKSTORE_PASSWORD_HASH` for the Bookstore dashboard.

### Rotation recovery

If the helper's printed hash is lost before the Secret is updated, no state has
changed. Rerun the helper with the same current password and choose a new value.
Do not look for hashes in application logs.

If the Secret was updated but the rollout has not happened, the old pod still
uses its startup environment. Correct or roll back the Secret, then restart.
Database and Litestream recovery are not part of credential recovery because
their password-hash copies are derived from the Secret.

To rerun the helper:

```bash
kubectl -n tai-passport exec -it deploy/passports-app -- \
  python -m backend.manage_passwords change --location csc
```

Do not store plaintext dashboard passwords in Helm values, ConfigMaps, or the
repository.

## Ride-along services

None. Single-container app.

## Helm chart

- Location in repo: `chart/`
- `helm lint` + `helm template` pass: yes
- Litestream enabled by default for safe SQLite on NFS storage. Set `litestream.enabled: false` and `persistence.enabled: false` if data persistence isn't needed.

## Access & data

- **Audience:** campus-only (default)
- **Login needed?** yes (location-based JWT auth via password) — no SAML/OAuth; flag to platform team if auth proxy integration is desired
- **Data classification:** P1/P2 only confirmed? yes — visitor names, emails, phone numbers (contact info for passport service appointments; no SSN, no financial data, no health info)
